### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m working on Unreal in the day, learning and reading at night
- ⚡ I'm currently interested in game engine development, performance analysis and low-level system programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning LLM and find it pretty interesting
- ✨ Most of my repos are learning materials and notes, don't take them seriously
