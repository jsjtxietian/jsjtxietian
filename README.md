### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on Unity in the day, contributing to Godot at night
- âš¡ I'm currently interested in game engine development, performance analysis and low-level rendering techniques
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and find it pretty interesting
- âœ¨ Most of my repos are learning materials and notes, don't take them seriously
